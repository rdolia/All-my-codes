#Problem Statement
#1. Test whether two vectors are exactly equal (element by
#                                               element)
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))

#2. Sort the character vector in ascending order and descending
#order
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))

sort(vec1,decreasing = FALSE)
sort(vec1,decreasing = TRUE)

sort(vec2,decreasing = FALSE)
sort(vec2,decreasing = TRUE)

#3.What is the major difference between str c() and paste()
#show an example.
